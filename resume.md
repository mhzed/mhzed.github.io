## Introduction

I am a software industry veteran with 20+ years of experience.  I've worked in environments ranging from startups to established Enterprises.  I have realized throughout my career that I love problem solving.  The joy of work comes from solving problems and helping others (colleagues, customers, community, etc.) in the process, everything else is just noise.  I am an avid learner of new technologies, which comes with the territory of a problem solver.  My career goal is to find challenging problems to solve and be useful to others, and I hope my quest for this goal will land me at your company.
