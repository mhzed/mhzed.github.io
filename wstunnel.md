# wstunnel

A websocket based tunnel.

The projected is hosted in [github](https://github.com/mhzed/wstunnel).  

The inspiration behind this project was to circumvent strict firewalls that does packet level inspections to block connections.  A lot coorporate intranets and some countries do this.  Websocket is part of HTML5 standard and blocking it would mean crippling the web.  As a side-effect, wstunnel also works pretty well to obfuscate the real VPN or SSH traffic.
